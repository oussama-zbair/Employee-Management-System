This repository contains a C program that implements an employee management system. This system allows users to perform various tasks related to managing employees in an organization, such as:

- Adding new employees to a database
- Modifying existing employee records
- Listing all employees
- Searching for an employee by name or ID
- Modifying employee records
- Deleting employee records

The system uses file handling and data structures in C to store and retrieve employee information. It also utilizes various functions and control structures to implement its features. The user interface is text-based and it uses graphics.h and conio.h libraries to create a graphical user interface. Input validation has been added to ensure that the data entered is correct. The system uses fwrite and fflush functions to write and flush the data entered, respectively. The system utilizes a switch statement to switch between different menu options.

Please use the following command in your command line to run the code:

```
gcc -o employee_management employee_management.c
```
Then execute the code:

```
./employee_management
```
